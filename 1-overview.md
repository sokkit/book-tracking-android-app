Read Me is an app to allow users to log the books they have read and books they want to read.

When logging books they have read, users will be able to record a rating, a review, and some favourite quotes. This will be the MVP. It should also have functionality for users to create shareable pictures with some of their favourite quotes. I plan to use the Google Books API to perform searches for books and retrieve extra information, such as book covers.

I have decided to build this app as I am a keen reader, and this would be useful for someone like me. It would be targeted to other keen readers and people wanting to read more. When choosing a new book to buy, it would be useful to go back through what you have read to see what sort of books you have given a high or low rating. Users can look at their list of books they want to read when they come across book shops. For someone that may have a goal to read more books, having a count of how many books you have read can act as a motivator.
