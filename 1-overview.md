Read Me is an app to allow users to log the books they have read and books they want to read. 

When logging books they have read, users will be able to record a rating, a review, and some favourite quotes. This will be the MVP. As a “good to have”, I would like to add functionality for users to create shareable pictures with some of their favourite quotes.

I have decided to build this app as I am a keen reader, and this would be useful for someone like me. When choosing a new book to buy, it would be useful to go back through what you have read to see what sort of books you have given a high or low rating. Users can look at their list of books they want to read when they come across book shops. For someone that may have a goal to read more books, it can be useful and satisfying to see how many books you have read.
