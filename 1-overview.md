Read Me is an app to allow users to log the books they have read and books they want to read. 

When logging books they have read, users will be able to record a rating, a review, and some favourite quotes. This will be the MVP. It should also have functionality for users to create shareable pictures with some of their favourite quotes.

I have decided to build this app as I am a keen reader, and this would be useful for someone like me. It would be targeted to other keen readers and people wanting to read more. When choosing a new book to buy, it would be useful to go back through what you have read to see what sort of books you have given a high or low rating. Users can look at their list of books they want to read when they come across book shops. For someone that may have a goal to read more books, having a count of how many books you have read can act as a motivator.

Formative comments from Sandy

Here are my comments on where you're at so far, I hope they're useful:

- This is a really nicely constrained app. It has a clear focus and motivation and I can see it being useful to people who get through books at a rapid pace.

- You have a few more words available to use. I wonder if you could signpost/flag-up more sophisticated functionality you could start to bring into the app. Are there APIs available for retrieving book information (perhaps free, or using your Cardiff library access)? This could help fill out additional information for the user. What about capturing images and storing them? You're correct to focus on the MVP, but you want to have a clear idea of where you're going after that. 

- Critically, you want to be showing off what you've learned about the API during the module, without chucking stuff in for the sake of it. The features have to be a good fit for the app more broadly.

- Are there things from existing apps that do this that you could improve on?

- Overall, very clear, just think about how you can stretch yourself with the project idea.
