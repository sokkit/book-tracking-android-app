I managed to achieve the application’s MVP as well as some other features. I think I made a good choice starting with the search feature as it helped me get the hang of some of the parts of the Android API I would use throughout the project, such as `Volley`, `Views`, and `Layouts`.

I wanted to create shareable pictures with quotes overlayed on a book cover but couldn’t get high enough resolution pictures from the API. I created an alternative solution by using `ACTION_SEND Intents` with text added separately.

The application has many similar looking pages by design. A problem I ran in to trying to achieve this was that I had much repeated code. With greater thought to code architecture, I could have lessened this problem. 

If I had more time, I would have improved the trophies page. It doesn’t convey its functionality clearly enough. I needed to change the colour of specific `TextViews` in a `RecylerView` based on user criteria and didn’t figure it out in time. I also would have moved to an online storage solution such as a PythonAnywhere server so that data isn’t lost when clearing the application’s storage.
