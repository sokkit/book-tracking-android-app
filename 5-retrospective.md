I managed to achieve the application’s MVP as well as some other features. I think I made a good choice starting with the search feature as it helped me get the hang of some of the parts of the Android API I would use throughout the project, such as `Volley`, `Views`, and `Layouts`.

I wanted to create shareable pictures with quotes overlayed on a book cover but couldn’t get high enough resolution pictures from the API. I created an alternative solution by using `ACTION_SEND Intents` with text added separately.

The application has many similar looking pages by design. A problem I ran in to trying to achieve this was that I had much repeated code. With greater thought to code architecture, I could have lessened this problem. 

If I had more time, I would have improved the trophies page. It doesn’t convey its functionality clearly enough. I needed to change the colour of specific `TextViews` in a `RecylerView` based on user criteria and didn’t figure it out in time. I also would have moved to an online storage solution such as a PythonAnywhere server so that data isn’t lost when clearing the application’s storage.

– Appreciate space is at a premium here, but make sure you are giving the necessary level of detail. For example, you say 'with greater thought to code architecture'... OK, what code arch would that bit and how it would be better for your development?

– You might be able to make some space with some of your more general statements, like the first sentence. It certainly seems true, from what I've seen of the app, but it doesn't really convey much specific to your app and I'd probably drop it so that I could use the worse elsewhere.

– Would there be any drawbacks of using cloud storage for an app like this, or would it be plain sailing?

- Can you point to specific components that involved code reuse that you think should be fixed?
