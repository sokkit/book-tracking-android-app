I made a good choice starting with the search feature. It helped me learn some of the Android API components I would use throughout the project, such as `Volley`, `Views`, and `Layouts`.

I wanted to create shareable pictures with quotes overlayed on a book cover but couldn’t get high enough resolution pictures from the API. I created an alternative solution by using `ACTION_SEND Intents` with text added separately.

One issue I had was adding key functionality like list sorting too late. As a result, there is essentially identical code in the Read, Reading, and TBR `Fragments`. I could have grouped these into one `Fragment` and filtered between categories using list sorting.

If I had more time, I would have improved the trophies page. It doesn’t convey its functionality clearly enough. I needed to change the colour of `TextViews` in a `RecylerView` based on user criteria and didn’t complete it in time. I also would have moved to an online storage solution such as a PythonAnywhere server so data isn’t lost when storage is cleared. Disadvantages of this are potential security concerns (I would likely need a user system), and that less of the application’s features would work offline.
